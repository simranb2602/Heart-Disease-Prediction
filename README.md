The Heart Disease Prediction project is designed to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals using machine learning models. It includes data related to key health indicators like cholesterol, blood pressure, age, and lifestyle habits. The project was created to help healthcare professionals identify high-risk patients early, enabling timely intervention. It contains data processing scripts, machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest, and evaluation metrics to assess model performance. Users can input health data, train the models, and predict heart disease risk, with tools available to evaluate the results for accuracy and effectiveness.
